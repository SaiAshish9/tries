A trie (pronounced "try"), also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure
used to store a dynamic set of strings where the keys are usually strings.
It is typically used for efficient retrieval of keys that have a common prefix.

Here are some key points about tries:

Structure: A trie is a tree data structure where each node represents a single character
of a string. The root node represents an empty string, and each path from the root to
a leaf node represents a unique string. Nodes may also have associated values (e.g.,
to store additional information related to the string).

Efficiency: Tries are efficient for tasks like prefix matching, searching for strings with
 a common prefix, and autocomplete functionality. The time complexity for searching, inserting,
  or deleting a key in a trie is typically O(m), where m is the length of the key.

Space Efficiency: While tries offer fast retrieval times, they can consume a significant
amount of memory, especially when storing large numbers of short strings. However, memory
optimization techniques like compression (e.g., using a compressed trie) can help mitigate this issue.

Applications: Tries are commonly used in applications like spell checkers, autocomplete features,
 IP routing (e.g., IP address lookup), and implementing efficient dictionaries or sets.

Variants: There are different variants of tries, such as compressed tries (tries with nodes
 that have multiple characters), ternary search tries (tries optimized for space efficiency),
  and radix trees (tries optimized for integer keys).

Overall, tries are a powerful data structure for storing and efficiently retrieving strings,
 especially when dealing with tasks that involve matching prefixes or partial strings.
